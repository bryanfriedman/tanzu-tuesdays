<p>Welcome! If you&rsquo;re here, it means you&rsquo;re a willing participant in this zany thing we call Tanzu Tuesdays. You&rsquo;re probably here to help keep things running smoothly, or perhaps you want to star in your very own episode. Stay tuned and let&rsquo;s talk through scheduling an Episode.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: This is not set in stone, if you have a better way to do this, we&rsquo;re all ears. Just trying to keep things simple and all in one place.</p>

<p><em>We assume you have some familiarity with github, and can perform basic git actions such as <code>git clone</code>, <code>git pull</code>, <code>git push</code>, and create <strong>Pull Requests</strong>. If you do not know how to do these things that&rsquo;s okay, just contact us on slack and we&rsquo;ll help.</em></p>

<h2 id="add-a-new-episode-to-the-schedule">Add a new episode to the schedule</h2>

<p>We manage the schedule using a simple Github Projects kanban board <a href="https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/tanzu-tuesdays/projects/1">here</a>.</p>

<p>The first item in the <strong>To do</strong> column is a template, hit the <strong>&hellip;</strong> button and select <strong>Edit note</strong> copy the contents and then create a new issue and paste in those contents.</p>

<p>Update the Episode Number and Date as well as the <strong>Host</strong> and <strong>Guest</strong> and save it. Move to the <strong>In Progress</strong> column.</p>

<p><img src="./tanzu-schedule.png" alt="screenshot of tanzu schedule" /></p>

<h2 id="request-an-avatar-and-episode-image">Request an Avatar and Episode image</h2>

<p>We create delightful avatars for each of our guests. You&rsquo;ll need to <a href="http://vmwmare.com">request</a> <strong>todo add instructions on how</strong> an avatar from the art team, and a corresponding Episode image.</p>

<p>The avatar will be uploaded to <a href="https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/tanzu-tuesdays/tree/master/content/img/avatars">here</a> and the Episode image will be added to their episode page (described below).</p>

<h2 id="create-a-guest-page">Create a guest page</h2>

<p>From here we need to prepare the guest&rsquo;s page and the episode page. If they&rsquo;re a recurring guest then the guest page should already exist <a href="https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/tanzu-tuesdays/tree/master/content/guest">here</a>. If not then copy the <code>content/guest/_new.md</code> to a new file and modify it.</p>

<p>You should have a Bio and a Headshot for the guest, along with some social media handles. The Bio goes into the body of the page, whereas the rest goes into the front-matter (the section between the <code>+++</code> lines).</p>

<pre><code class="language-hugo">+++

[Jakub](https://twitter.com/JakubPilimon) is a Developer Advocate at [VMware](https://vmware.com), blogger, programmer, and trainer. He loves to tackle complex enterprises with Domain-Driven Design, Test-Driven Development and Spring. Architecture is a main area of interest, too. When he doesn't program, he rides motorbikes, skis or practices kitesurfing.

He writes a [DZone MVB awarded blog](https://pillopl.github.io) and his pet projects can be found at [https://github.com/ddd-by-examples](https://github.com/ddd-by-examples).

<p>Once the guest page is complete and merged into git you can mark it as complete in the schedule.</p>

<h2 id="create-an-episode-page">Create an Episode page</h2>

<p>You&rsquo;ll also need an episode page. These can be found <a href="https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/tanzu-tuesdays/tree/master/content/episode">here</a>. Each episode has its own directory and you can copy the <code>content/episode/_new</code> directory to draft a new episode.</p>

<p>The following is a completed episode page. The author is you, the hosts is a list of people that will be hosting the stream (they must have an entry in <a href="https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/tanzu-tuesdays/tree/master/content/host">hosts</a>) and the guests is a list of guests (must have an entry in <a href="https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/tanzu-tuesdays/tree/master/content/guest">guests</a>).</p>
